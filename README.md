# Programming_Project

Final project for the Programming Class (Data Science, Year 2022/2023).

This project explore a survery on Mental Health in Tech.
The dataset i'm going to investigate is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 

The organization that has collected this data is the "Open Sourcing Mental Health" organization (OSMH).
Open Sourcing Mental Health is a non-profit, corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities.

The folder contains:
- files automatically created by vscode
- the raw dataset (*survey.csv*)
- the clean dataset (*survey_clean.csv*)
- some useful files for the project like the *eu_states.csv* and *corr_values.png*
- the main file project.py
- the jupyter notebook of the project, which also contain some parts that aren't present in the final version .py
